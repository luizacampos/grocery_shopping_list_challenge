# Grocery Shopping List - Code Challenge

Create a grocery shopping list. You can add items in the frontend. This data is stored in the backend. The list shows the items. You can create new items, you can delete items and you can modify items. So, if you want to change "tomaeteos" (misspelled) to "tomatoes", you can. All updated are stored in backend.

## Bonus task

We are using google firebase to bring code alive. It would be a great advantage, if you are able to deploy the code to firebase (or any other platform), so that I can test your grocery shopping application directly online. While I test the app in the frontend, our developers will inspect your code in the backend. You don't necessarily have to deploy on firebase, just deploy somewhere so that I can test the application without seeing the code.

## Bonus task for professionals:

Add a priority number to each item on the list, for example between 1 and 5 (1 is the highest priority), and the priority items appear first on the list, but after they are checked as done (or already bought) they will go to the bottom of the list. If I for example want to point out that onions are quite important, I would give the onions a 2 so that they are directly displayed below all the items with a 1.

### Host your code on GitHub (& firebase/etc.) and send me the links.
